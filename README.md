Object Tracker
Description

Object Tracker is a C++ application designed for tracking objects in a given environment using computer vision techniques. The application processes video input, detects objects, and follows their movement over time, providing useful tracking data.
Features

    Real-time object detection and tracking
    Support for multiple tracking algorithms (e.g., Kalman Filter, Mean-Shift, Optical Flow)
    Configurable parameters for enhanced tracking accuracy
    Video input from a webcam or pre-recorded files
    Logging and visualization of object movement

Requirements

    C++17 or newer
    OpenCV (for image processing and object tracking)
    CMake (for building the project)
